      <h3>Top tips and tricks for <span>planning a conference:</span></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The agenda and guest speakers will be the selling factor for potential registrants (remember that the best guest speakers get snapped up quickly, so book them ASAP).</li>
        <li><span class="mark">Strong attendance</span> brings revenue and adds sponsorship opportunities.</li>
        <li>The conference theme will help unify your ideas and secure appropriate guest speakers and expo partners, as well as allow you to identify the right parties to market to.</li>
        <li>Think about where to hold your conference - an attractive location will help bring the punters in.</li>
        <li><span class="mark">Use social media</span>to generate buzz, boost attendance and keep your event in people’s minds far beyond the end-date.</li>
        <li>Avoid surprises when renting a conference hall or working with vendors by getting all agreements in writing.</li>
        <li>Coordinate the details by walking through your itinerary as your attendees would.</li>
        <li>Be well prepared – communicate with vendors and arrive at the venue early, so you have plenty of time to set up and check last-minute services (and make sure to test computers, internet connections, projectors, and other A/V equipment before the day).</li>
        <li>Mix on-stage discussion panels with stand-alone speakers.</li>
        <li><span class="mark">Schedule regular breaks</span>, especially for half-day or full-day sessions (breaks every 60–80 minutes are ideal).</li>
        <li>Keep your session on track and on time (let your guest speakers know how much time they’ve been allotted for their presentation, and make sure to account for the time it takes for guest speakers to get up on stage, be introduced, get their presentation up on the screen, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
